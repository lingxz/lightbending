abstract = {We study the effect of the cosmological constant on the observation of gravitational lenses. It is shown that some of the lens observables are strongly affected by the cosmological constant, especially in a low-density universe, and its existence might be determined by a statistical study of lenses. In particular, the optical depth of the lens distribution may be used best for this purpose without referring much to the lens model. With a non-zero cosmological constant the optical depth increases rapidly as the source redshift increases, and the lens distribution has a peak at a substantially deeper redshift than if the cosmological constant were zero.},

abstract = {The Oslo rice pile model is a sandpile-like paradigmatic model of ``Self-Organized Criticality'' (SOC). In this paper it is shown that the Oslo model is in fact exactly a discrete realization of the much studied quenched Edwards-Wilkinson equation (qEW) [Nattermann et al., J. Phys. II France 2, 1483 (1992)]. This is possible by choosing the correct dynamical variable and identifying its equation of motion. It establishes for the first time an exact link between SOC models and the field of interface growth with quenched disorder. This connection is obviously very encouraging as it suggests that established theoretical techniques can be brought to bear with full strength on some of the hitherto elusive problems of SOC.},

abstract = {We propose a random graph model which is a special case of sparse random graphs with given degree sequences which satisfy a power law. This model involves only a small number of parameters, called log- size and log-log growth rate. These parameters capture some universal characteristics of massive graphs. Furthermore, from these parame- ters, various properties of the graph can be derived. For example, for certain ranges of the parameters, we will compute the expected distri- bution of the sizes of the connected components which almost surely occur with high probability. We will illustrate the consistency of our model with the behavior of some massive graphs derived from data in telecommunications. We will also discuss the threshold function, the giant component, and the evolution of random graphs in this model.},

They also * Detail the various decisions to be made when applying Chi-squared tests to real data, and the proper application of these tests in standard hypothesis-testing situations * Describe how Chi-squared type tests allow statisticians to construct a test statistic whose distribution is asymptotically Chi-squared, and to compute power against various alternatives * Devote half of the book to examples of Chi-squared tests that can be easily adapted to situations not covered in the book * Provide a self-contained, accessible treatment of the mathematical requisites * Include an extensive bibliography and suggestions for further reading},

abstract = {We give an intuitive though general explanation of the finite-size effect in scale-free networks in terms of the degree distribution of the starting network. This result clarifies the relevance of the starting network in the final degree distribution. We use two different approaches: the deterministic mean-field approximation used by Barab$\backslash$'asi and Albert (but taking into account the nodes of the starting network), and the probability distribution of the degree of each node, which considers the stochastic process. Numerical simulations show that the accuracy of the predictions of the mean-field approximation depend on the contribution of the dispersion in the final distribution. The results in terms of the probability distribution of the degree of each node are very accurate when compared to numerical simulations. The analysis of the standard deviation of the degree distribution allows us to assess the influence of the starting core when fitting the model to real data.},

abstract = {Reduced chi-squared is a very popular method for model assessment, model comparison, convergence diagnostic, and error estimation in astronomy. In this manuscript, we discuss the pitfalls involved in using reduced chi-squared. There are two independent problems: (a) The number of degrees of freedom can only be estimated for linear models. Concerning nonlinear models, the number of degrees of freedom is unknown, i.e., it is not possible to compute the value of reduced chi-squared. (b) Due to random noise in the data, also the value of reduced chi-squared itself is subject to noise, i.e., the value is uncertain. This uncertainty impairs the usefulness of reduced chi-squared for differentiating between models or assessing convergence of a minimisation procedure. The impact of noise on the value of reduced chi-squared is surprisingly large, in particular for small data sets, which are very common in astrophysical problems. We conclude that reduced chi-squared can only be used with due caution for linear models, whereas it must not be used for nonlinear models at all. Finally, we recommend more sophisticated and reliable methods, which are also applicable to nonlinear models.},

Some proposals of how such an effect may be put into a setting of gravitational lensing in cosmology are also discussed. The picture that emerges from this review is that it seems fair to assert that the contribution of Lambda to the bending of light has by now been well established, while putting the Lambda light-bending terms into a cosmological context is still subject to some interpretation and requires further work and clarification.},

abstract = {A dynamically preferred quasi-local definition of gravitational energy is given in terms of the Hamiltonian of a `2+2' formulation of general relativity. The energy is well-defined for any compact orientable spatial 2-surface, and depends on the fundamental forms only. The energy is zero for any surface in flat spacetime, and reduces to the Hawking mass in the absence of shear and twist. For asymptotically flat spacetimes, the energy tends to the Bondi mass at null infinity and the $\backslash$ADM mass at spatial infinity, taking the limit along a foliation parametrised by area radius. The energy is calculated for the Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstr$\backslash$"om and Robertson-Walker solutions, and for plane waves and colliding plane waves. Energy inequalities are discussed, and for static black holes the irreducible mass is obtained on the horizon. Criteria for an adequate definition of quasi-local energy are discussed.},

We present flux density measurements of the whole sample of 323 galaxies of the HRS in the three bands of the Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver (SPIRE), at 250, 350 and 500 microns. Aperture photometry is performed on extended galaxies and point spread function (PSF) fitting on timeline data for unresolved objects; we carefully estimate errors and upper limits. The flux densities are found to be in good agreement with those of the HeViCS and KINGFISH key projects in all SPIRE bands, and of the Planck consortium at 350 and 550 microns, for the galaxies in common. This submillimetre catalogue of nearby galaxies is a benchmark for the study of the dust properties in the local universe, giving the zero redshift reference for any cosmological survey.},

We begin by recasting a linearly perturbed FRW model into the$\backslash$nKottler metric, showing that the FRW description involves a potential that has$\backslash$nno explicit dependence on Lambda. Thus the standard cosmological lensing$\backslash$nresults are unaffected by the presence of Lambda, which appears only though its$\backslash$nusual role in defining the angular-diameter distance. To explore the physical$\backslash$norigins of the apparent Lambda-dependent potential that appears in the static$\backslash$nKottler metric, we work in the low-velocity limit, highlighting the two$\backslash$nclassical effects which lead to the aberration of light. The first relates to$\backslash$nthe observer's motion relative to the source, and encapsulates the familiar$\backslash$nconcept of angular-diameter distance. The second term, which has proved to be$\backslash$nthe source of debate, arises from cosmic acceleration, but is rarely considered$\backslash$nsince it vanishes for photons with radial motion. This apparent form of$\backslash$nlight-bending gives the appearance of curved geodesics even within a flat and$\backslash$nhomogeneous universe. However this cannot be construed as a real lensing$\backslash$neffect, since its value depends on the observer's frame of reference. Our$\backslash$nconclusion is thus that standard results for gravitational lensing in a$\backslash$nuniverse containing Lambda do not require modification.},

abstract = {Using DIRBE and FIRAS maps at high latitude ({\$}|b|{\textgreater}10{\^{}}{\{}\backslashcirc{\}}{\$}) we derive the spatial distribution of the dust temperature associated with the diffuse cirrus and the dense molecular clouds. For a {\$}\nu{\^{}}2{\$} emissivity law, we find that the equilibrium dust temperature of the cirrus is about 17.5 K with only small variations over the high latitude sky. Comparison of the far Infrared DIRBE maps shows the presence of a colder emission component with a temperature around 15 K, assuming a {\$}\nu{\^{}}2{\$} emissivity law. The lowest values of the temperature found in the cold regions ({\$}{\~{}}13 K{\$}) are compatible with the results recently obtained for dense cores in star forming regions by the balloon-borne experiment SPM-PRONAOS (Ristorcelli et al., 1996, 1998, Serra et al., 1997). This cold component is in particular present in the direction of known molecular complexes with low star forming activity such as Taurus. The association between the cold component and molecular clouds is further demonstrated by the fact that all sky pixels with significant cold emission have an excess IR emission with respect to the high latitude IR/HI correlation. We have deduced a threshold value of the column density, {\$}N{\_}{\{}HI{\}} = 2.5 10{\^{}}{\{}20{\}} H/cm{\^{}}2{\$}, below which cold dust is not detected within the FIRAS beam of {\$}{\~{}}7\backslashdegr{\$}. We have re-examined the problem of the existence of a very cold dust component ({\$}T {\~{}}7 K{\$}) by combining DIRBE maps of the cold emission with FIRAS spectra, corrected for the isotropic component found in Puget et al.

Departing from a degree distribution obtained from the Barab$\backslash$'asi-Albert (BA) algorithm, networks were generated using four additional different algorithms a (Molloy-Reed, Kalisky, and two new models named A and B) besides the BA algorithm itself. For each network, we have calculated the following structural measures: average degree of the nearest neighbours, central point dominance, clustering coefficient, the Pearson correlation coefficient, and global efficiency. We found that different networks with the same degree distribution may have distinct structural properties. In particular, model B generates decentralized networks with a larger number of components, a smaller giant component size, and a low global efficiency when compared to the other algorithms, especially compared to the centralized BA networks that have all vertices in a single component, with a medium to high global efficiency. The other three models generate networks with intermediate characteristics between B and BA models. A consequence of this finding is that the dynamics of different phenomena on these networks may differ considerably.},

For high-redshift lens-quasar systems, the uncertainty associated with the distance formulation for the prediction of optical depth of lenses is substantial enough to make discrimination between low and high density universe models difficult. But the cosmological constant increases optical depth greatly, and therefore the lensing frequency provides a simple test for the cosmological constant. For a low-redshift system cosmological models can probably be discriminated by the optical depth given large, homogeneous lens samples. An estimate is made of selection effects and corrections to the model in order to predict lensing frequencies for a realistic case. The provisional conclusion is that a very large cosmological constant (e.g. larger than about 0.95 in the flat geometry) is excluded. The effect of gravitational lensing with a cosmological constant on the quasar-galaxy correlation and on fluctuations in the cosmic background radiation is also studied and found to be insignificant.},

In contrast, the word problems each ask “how long until a chain does something?”, and the focus of this book is on finite-time behavior. More precisely, the word problems ask about hitting times, the time until a state or a set of states is first visited, or until each state in a set is visited; or ask about mixing times, the number of steps until the distribution is approximately the stationary distribution. The card-shuffling problems (section 1.1.4) provide a very intuitive setting for such questions; how many shuffles are needed, as a function of the size of the deck, until the deck is well shuffled? Such size-asymptotic results, of which (1.1) is perhaps the best-known, are one of the themes of this book. Thus in one sense our work is in the spirit of the birthday and coupon-collector's problems in undergraduate probability; in another sense our goals are reminiscent of those of computational complexity (P =? NP and all that), which seeks to relate the time required to solve an algorithmic problem to the size of the problem.},

Tracer particles were added to a pile and their transit times measured. The distribution of transit times is a constant with a crossover to a decaying power law. The average transport velocity decreases with system size. This is due to an increase in the active zone depth with system size. The relaxation processes generate coherently moving regions of grains mixed with convection. This picture is supported by considering transport in a {\$}1D{\$} cellular automaton modeling the experiment.},

abstract = {Recent studies suggest that the cosmological constant affects the gravitational bending of photons, although the orbital equation for light in Schwarzschild–de Sitter space-time is free from a cosmological constant. Here we argue that the very notion of a cosmological constant independent of the photon orbit in the Schwarzschild–de Sitter space-time is not proper. Consequently, the cosmological constant has some clear contributions to the deflection angle of light rays. We stress the importance of the study of photon trajectories from the reference objects in bending calculations, particularly for asymptotically nonflat space-time. When such an aspect is taken into consideration, the contribution of a cosmological constant to the effective bending is found to depend on the distances of the source and the reference objects.},

@article{Spergel2003,
abstract = {WMAP precision data enables accurate testing of cosmological models. We find that the emerging standard model of cosmology, a flat Lambda-dominated universe seeded by nearly scale-invariant adiabatic Gaussian fluctuations, fits the WMAP data. With parameters fixed only by WMAP data, we can fit finer scale CMB measurements and measurements of large scle structure (galaxy surveys and the Lyman alpha forest). This simple model is also consistent with a host of other astronomical measurements. We then fit the model parameters to a combination of WMAP data with other finer scale CMB experiments (ACBAR and CBI), 2dFGRS measurements and Lyman alpha forest data to find the model's best fit cosmological parameters: h=0.71+0.04-0.03, Omega{\_}b h{\^{}}2=0.0224+-0.0009, Omega{\_}m h{\^{}}2=0.135+0.008-0.009, tau=0.17+-0.06, n{\_}s(0.05/Mpc)=0.93+-0.03, and sigma{\_}8=0.84+-0.04. WMAP's best determination of tau=0.17+-0.04 arises directly from the TE data and not from this model fit, but they are consistent. These parameters imply that the age of the universe is 13.7+-0.2 Gyr. The data favors but does not require a slowly varying spectral index. By combining WMAP data with other astronomical data sets, we constrain the geometry of the universe, Omega{\_}tot = 1.02 +- 0.02, the equation of state of the dark energy w {\textless} -0.78 (95{\%} confidence limit assuming w {\textgreater}= -1), and the energy density in stable neutrinos, Omega{\_}nu h{\^{}}2 {\textless} 0.0076 (95{\%} confidence limit). For 3 degenerate neutrino species, this limit implies that their mass is less than 0.23 eV (95{\%} confidence limit). The WMAP detection of early reionization rules out warm dark matter.},

abstract = {The cosmological constant Lambda affects cosmological gravitational lensing. Effects due to Lambda can be studied in the framework of the Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime. Two novel contributions, which cannot be accounted for by a proper use of angular diameter distances, are derived. First, a term deltaalpha[over ;]{\_}(Lambda)=2mbLambda/3 has to be added to the bending angle, where m is the lens mass and b the impact parameter. Second, Lambda brings about a difference in the redshifts of multiple images. Both effects are quite small for real astrophysical systems, deltaalpha[over ;]{\_}(Lambda) less, similar1muarcsec and Deltaz{\_}(s) less, similar10(-7).},

The gravitational bending of a light ray is affected by the cosmological constant, in agreement with the findings of some previous investigations. The present study confirms that the leading correction term depends directly not only on the cosmological constant but also on the impact parameter and on the angular distance to the source. Using the resulting lens equation, the projected mass of the lens was estimated for several systems displaying Einstein rings. Corrections on masses due to the cosmological constant are, on the average, of the order of 2{\%}, indicating that they are not completly negligible for lens systems at cosmological distances.},

abstract = {Acinetobacter baumannii contains RND-family efflux systems AdeABC and AdeIJK, which pump out a wide range of antimicrobial compounds, as judged from the MIC changes occurring upon deletion of the responsible genes. However, these studies may miss changes because of the high backgrounds generated by the remaining pumps and by $\beta$-lactamases, and it is unclear how the activities of these pumps compare quantitatively with those of the well-studied AcrAB-TolC system of Escherichia coli. We expressed adeABC and adeIJK of A. baumannii, as well as E. coli acrAB, in an E. coli host from which acrAB was deleted. The A. baumannii pumps were functional in E. coli, and the MIC changes that were observed largely confirmed the substrate range already reported, with important differences. Thus, the AdeABC system pumped out all $\beta$-lactams, an activity that was often missed in deletion studies. When the expression level of the pump genes was adjusted to a similar level for a comparison with AcrAB-TolC, we found that both A. baumannii efflux systems pumped out a wide range of compounds, but AdeABC was less effective than AcrAB-TolC in the extrusion of lipophilic $\beta$-lactams, novobiocin, and ethidium bromide, although it was more effective at tetracycline efflux. AdeIJK was remarkably more effective than a similar level of AcrAB-TolC in the efflux of $\beta$-lactams, novobiocin, and ethidium bromide, although it was less so in the efflux of erythromycin. These results thus allow us to compare these efflux systems on a quantitative basis, if we can assume that the heterologous systems are fully functional in the E. coli host.},

With the images and redshifts observed in the EM domain combined with very precise measurements of time delays from lensed GW signals, we can achieve precise cosmography in the era of third-generation gravitational-wave detectors. In particular we demonstrate that the uncertainty of the Hubble constant H0 determination from just 10 such systems can decrease to ∼ 0.4{\%} in a flat $\Lambda$CDM universe.},

abstract = {We have discovered 16 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and have used them to provide the first conclusive evidence for cosmic deceleration that preceded the current epoch of cosmic acceleration. These objects, discovered during the course of the GOODS ACS Treasury program, include 6 of the 7 highest-redshift SNe Ia known, all at z{\textgreater}1.25, and populate the Hubble diagram in unexplored territory. The luminosity distances to these and 170 previous SNe Ia are provided. A purely kinematic interpretation of the SN Ia sample provides evidence at the {\textgreater} 99{\%} confidence level for a transition from deceleration to acceleration or similarly, strong evidence for a cosmic jerk. Using a simple model of the expansion history, the transition between the two epochs is constrained to be at z=0.46 +/- 0.13. The data are consistent with the cosmic concordance model of Omega{\_}M {\~{}} 0.3, Omega{\_}Lambda{\~{}}0.7 (chi{\^{}}2{\_}dof=1.06), and are inconsistent with a simple model of evolution or dust as an alternative to dark energy.

When combined with external flat-Universe constraints we find w=-1.02 + 0.13 - 0.19 (and {\$}{\textless}-0.76 at the 95{\%} confidence level) for an assumed static equation of state of dark energy, P = w\backslashrho c{\^{}}2. Joint constraints on both the recent equation of state of dark energy, {\$}w{\_}0{\$}, and its time evolution, dw/dz, are a factor of {\~{}}8 more precise than its first estimate and twice as precise as those without the SNe Ia discovered with HST. Our constraints are consistent with the static nature of and value of w expected for a cosmological constant (i.e., w{\_}0 = -1.0, dw/dz = 0), and are inconsistent with very rapid evolution of dark energy.

abstract = {Power-law distributions occur in many situations of scientific interest and have significant consequences for our understanding of natural and man-made phenomena. Unfortunately, the detection and characterization of power laws is complicated by the large fluctuations that occur in the tail of the distribution—the part of the distribution representing large but rare events— and by the difficulty of identifying the range over which power-law behavior holds. Commonly used methods for analyzing power-law data, such as least-squares fitting, can produce substantially inaccurate estimates of parameters for power-law distributions, and even in cases where such methods return accurate answers they are still unsatisfactory because they give no indication of whether the data obey a power law at all. Here we present a principled statistical framework for discerning and quantifying power-law behavior in empirical data. Our approach combines maximum-likelihood fitting methods with goodness-of-fit tests based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic and likelihood ratios. We evaluate the effectiveness of the approach with tests on synthetic data and give critical comparisons to previous approaches. We also apply the proposed methods to twenty-four real-world data sets from a range of different disciplines, each of which has been conjectured to follow a power-law distribution. In some cases we find these conjectures to be consistent with the data while in others the power law is ruled out.},

The data, corrected for internal extinction, are used to construct the spectral energy distribution (SED) of each individual galaxy, and combined to trace the median SED of galaxies in various classes of morphological type and luminosity. Low-luminosity, dwarf galaxies have on average bluer stellar continua and higher far-IR luminosities per unit galaxy mass than giant, early-type spirals. If compared to nearby starburst galaxies such as M82 and Arp 220, normal spirals have relatively similar observed stellar spectra but 10-100 times lower IR luminosities. The temperature of the cold dust component increases with the far-IR luminosity, from giant spirals to dwarf irregulars. The SED are used to separate the stellar emission from the dust emission in the mid-IR regime. We show that the contribution of the stellar emission at 6.75 micron to the total emission of galaxies is generally important, from {\~{}} 80{\%} in Sa to {\~{}} 20{\%} in Sc.},

abstract = {The idea of self-organized criticality(1) (SOC) is commonly illustrated conceptually with avalanches in a pile of sand grains. The grains are dropped onto a pile one by one, and the pile ultimately reaches a stationary 'critical' state in which its slope fluctuates about a constant angle of repose, with each new grain being capable of inducing an avalanche on any of the relevant size scales. Some numerical models of sand-pile dynamics do show SOC1-8, but the behaviour of real sand piles remains ambiguous(9-18). Here we describe experiments on a granular system--a pile of rice-in which the dynamics exhibit self-organized critical behaviour in one case (for grains with a large aspect ratio) but not in another (for less elongated grains). These results show that SOC is not as 'universal' and insensitive to the details of a system as was initially supposed(1), but that instead its occurrence depends on the detailed mechanism of energy dissipation.},

Geometric dark energy models generically predict a correction to the Einstein angle written in terms of the distance to the closest approach, whereas a cosmological constant $\Lambda$ does not. While dark energy is associated with a repulsive force in cosmological context, its effect on null geodesics in SSS space-times can be attractive as for the Newtonian term. This dark energy contribution may not be negligible with respect to the Einstein prediction in lensing involving clusters of galaxies. Strong lensing may therefore be useful to distinguish $\Lambda$ from other dark energy models.},

We present here a simple, specific and transparent example where {\$}\backslashLambda{\$} bending clearly takes place, and where it is clearly neither a coordinate effect nor an aberration effect. We then show that in some recent works using perturbation theory the {\$}\backslashLambda{\$} contribution was missed because of initial too-stringent smallness assumptions. Namely: Our method has been to insert a Kottler (Schwarzschild with {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}) vacuole into a Friedmann universe, and to calculate the total bending within the vacuole. We assume that no more bending occurs outside. It is important to observe that while the mass contribution to the bending takes place mainly quite near the lens, the {\$}\backslashLambda{\$} bending continues throughout the vacuole. Thus if one deliberately restricts one's search for {\$}\backslashLambda{\$} bending to the immediate neighborhood of the lens, one will not find it. Lastly, we show that the {\$}\backslashLambda{\$} bending also follows from standard Weyl focusing, and so again, it cannot be a coordinate effect.},

abstract = {Accurate and efficient methods to evaluate cosmological distances are an important tool in modern precision cosmology. In a flat {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM cosmology, the luminosity distance can be expressed in terms of elliptic integrals. We derive an alternative and simple expression for the luminosity distance in a flat {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM based on hypergeometric functions. Using a timing experiment we compare the computation time for the numerical evaluation of the various exact formulae, as well as for two approximate fitting formulae available in the literature. We find that our novel expression is the most efficient exact expression in the redshift range {\$}z\backslashgtrsim1{\$}. Ideally, it can be combined with the expression based on Carlson's elliptic integrals in the range {\$}z\backslashlesssim1{\$} for high precision cosmology distance calculations over the entire redshift range. On the other hand, for practical work where relative errors of about 0.1{\%} are acceptable, the analytical approximation proposed by Adachi {\&} Kasai (2012) is a suitable alternative.},

It is found that the interaction with the matter modifies the "peeling-off" behavior.

The group of coordinate transformations that preserve the asymptotic form of the metric and the boundary conditions is the same as the isometry group of the undisturbed Friedmann model. This may indicate that no physical significance attaches to the extra transformations of asymptotically flat space which are not contained in the inhomogeneous Lorentz group.},

Recent claims on the contrary (Dale et al. 2012) should be interpreted as a caveat to use in the simpler fits an absorption cross section which is consistent both in the normalization and in the spectral index beta with that of the full dust model. I also show that the dust mass does not depend significantly on the choice of beta, if both the dust mass and the absorption cross section are derived with the same assumption on beta.},

abstract = {This paper provides an overview of the Low Frequency Instrument (LFI) programme within the ESA Planck mission. The LFI instrument has been developed to produce high precision maps of the microwave sky at frequencies in the range 27-77 GHz, below the peak of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation spectrum. The scientific goals are described, ranging from fundamental cosmology to Galactic and extragalactic astrophysics. The instrument design and development are outlined, together with the model philosophy and testing strategy. The instrument is presented in the context of the Planck mission. The LFI approach to ground and inflight calibration is described. We also describe the LFI ground segment. We present the results of a number of tests demonstrating the capability of the LFI data processing centre (DPC) to properly reduce and analyse LFI flight data, from telemetry information to calibrated and cleaned time ordered data, sky maps at each frequency (in temperature and polarization), component emission maps (CMB and diffuse foregrounds), catalogs for various classes of sources (the Early Release Compact Source Catalogue and the Final Compact Source Catalogue). The organization of the LFI consortium is briefly presented as well as the role of the core team in data analysis and scientific exploitation. All tests carried out on the LFI flight model demonstrate the excellent performance of the instrument and its various subunits. The data analysis pipeline has been tested and its main steps verified. In the first three months after launch, the commissioning, calibration, performance, and verification phases will be completed, after which Planck will begin its operational life, in which LFI will have an integral part.},

abstract = {Many man-made and natural phenomena, including the intensity of earthquakes, population of cities and size of international wars, are believed to follow power-law distributions. The accurate identification of power-law patterns has significant consequences for correctly un-derstanding and modeling complex systems. However, statistical evi-dence for or against the power-law hypothesis is complicated by large fluctuations in the empirical distribution's tail, and these are wors-ened when information is lost from binning the data. We adapt the statistically principled framework for testing the power-law hypothe-sis, developed by Clauset, Shalizi and Newman, to the case of binned data. This approach includes maximum-likelihood fitting, a hypoth-esis test based on the Kolmogorov–Smirnov goodness-of-fit statistic and likelihood ratio tests for comparing against alternative explana-tions. We evaluate the effectiveness of these methods on synthetic binned data with known structure, quantify the loss of statistical power due to binning, and apply the methods to twelve real-world binned data sets with heavy-tailed patterns.},

@article{lake2007,
abstract = {Recently, Rindler and Ishak have argued that the bending of light is, in principle, changed by the presence of a cosmological constant since one must consider not only the null geodesic equation, but also the process of measurement. I agree with the fact that both must be considered. Here, on the basis of the mathematically exact solution to the classical bending problem, and independent of the cosmological constant, I clarify the approximate argument found in the vast majority of texts (new and old) for the measured value of the bending of light for a single source and show that the result is in part due to the almost perfect cancelation of two terms, one of which is seldom considered. When one considers two sources, this cancelation is of no consequence, and, for example, if the sources are opposite with the same associated apsidal distance, the approximate argument gives the rigorously correct answer (up to numerical evaluation), an answer which is unaffected by the presence of a cosmological constant.},

abstract = {We perform Monte Carlo simulations of large two-dimensional Gaussian Ising spin glasses down to very low temperatures {\$}\backslashbeta=1/T=50{\$}. Equilibration is ensured by using a cluster algorithm including Monte Carlo moves consisting of flipping fundamental excitations. We study the thermodynamic behavior using the Binder cumulant, the spin-glass susceptibility, the distribution of overlaps, the overlap with the ground state and the specific heat. We confirm that {\$}T{\_}c=0{\$}. All results are compatible with an algebraic divergence of the correlation length with an exponent {\$}\backslashnu{\$}. We find {\$}-1/\backslashnu=-0.295(30){\$}, which is compatible with the value for the domain-wall and droplet exponent {\$}\backslashtheta\backslashapprox-0.29{\$} found previously in ground-state studies. Hence the thermodynamic behavior of this model seems to be governed by one single exponent.},
