# kottler hole flat space

- there was a mistake in the code last time, the step size inside the hole was accidentally kept fixed and not changed with the changing step size, so there was a weird graph

# Lensed vs unlensed distances in Luke Butcher's paper

- See annotations in the paper
- Currently using unlensed
- How to calculate lensed distances in Swiss Cheese?

# Second term in Rindler and Ishak paper

- check the correction
- Do these values look sensible, given the size of the perturbation? Seem big

# Mathematica integration

- School has no free Mathematica
- Uses the same methods as Python (Adams method, BDF, Runge Kutta), seems to have a few more methods like
    + Explicit Euler
    + Midpoint rule method
    + MethodOfLines
- Uses the same Runge Kutta integrator as Python

# LTB hole

- Is LTB in comoving or static coordinates?
- How do you tell? Is it determined at the start or do they fall out of the EFEs and then you identify them as static/comoving
- how to determine E and E_r?
- consequently, how to determine R_r?
