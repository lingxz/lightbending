diff_lambdas_small2: latest, diff z_lens, 100 per Omega_Lambda, but wrong DL
diff_lambdas_small: same z_lens, diff z_source, 100 per Omega_Lambda
diff_lambdas_small3: same as diff_lambdas_small2, but with correct DL
diff_lambdas_small4: same as previous, but the step size in kottler solver is changed to agree with dt. Previously was fixed at 5e-7, oops!!!
diff_lambdas_bigger_redshifts: bigger redshifts, 0.2 to 1 instead of 0.05 to 0.2.
diff_lambdas_bigger_redshifts2ï¼š same as above, just more points
diff_lambdas_const_rh: constant rh, varying mass
diff_lambdas_const_rh2: same as above, bigger mass (10^13 solar masses instead of 10^12)
