% {\bf Abstract:} In this review, I survey some of the work analyzing the effect of the cosmological constant on gravitational deflection of light, a debate started mainly in a paper by \citet{Rindler2007} which challenged the conventional opinion. Since then, numerous papers have been written both in support and rebuttal of Rindler and Ishak. I go through the main arguments for and against a $\Lambda$-dependence in the lensing equation, identify limitations of some approaches, and look at the direction in which further work can take to settle this debate.
