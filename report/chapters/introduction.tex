\chapter{Introduction}

There has been a debate over the past decade about whether the cosmological constant enters directly into the gravitational lensing equation. 

\section{A review of the literature}
% The conventional view \cite{islam1983cosmological} states that the cosmological constant does not directly play a role in gravitational lensing, \cite{simpson2010lensing} apart from 


\section{Background}

In General Relativity, spacetime is described by a metric. 

The Einstein field equations (EFE)

This is the analogue of Poisson's equation in Newtonian gravity.

\section{A note on units and notation}
I use a comma to denote partial derivative. For example, $x_{,t}$ refers to $\frac{\partial x}{\partial t}$. Throughout this work I use natural units such that $c = G = 1$.
