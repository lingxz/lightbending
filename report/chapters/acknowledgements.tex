% \chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I wish to thank my supervisor Prof. Alan Heavens for his guidance and support through this project. I would also like to extend special thanks to Pierre Fleury, whom I've never met, for writing the paper that clearly laid out some of the important mathematics to get me started on light propagation in the Swiss-Cheese, without whom I would have been stuck for much longer.
